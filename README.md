# bitchScript
bitchScript is a scripting language for beginners, it follows syntax more minimal than Python. It is wrapper on Python since the compiler hasn't been written as of now, so it uses Python at backend to compile itself. 

It is completely opensource, any suggestion is more than welcome. 

P.S: It is still under progress now.
